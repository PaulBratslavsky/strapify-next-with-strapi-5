This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Note: READ FIRST

This template is based on the template by *web3templates* you can find the main repo [here](https://github.com/web3templates/nextly-template/).

I just update it the template to use `typescript` and `app` folder in Next.js 14. 

I wanted a simple starter template that I can use to show case how easy you can add a backend with [Strapi](https://strapi.io).

This is the updated project code that requires our Strapi backend that you can find here.

Once I finish the Strapi integration, I will add the link to the completed project here.

Original README.md is found below.
